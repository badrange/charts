# Silta Cluster Chart

This helm chart helps setting up resources for https://github.com/wunderio/silta-cluster-tf

## Requirements

Custom resource definitions for cert-manager (from https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/cert-manager):
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetstack/cert-manager/release-0.10/deploy/manifests/00-crds.yaml
kubectl create namespace silta-cluster
kubectl label namespace silta-cluster certmanager.k8s.io/disable-validation="true"
```

 - PriorityClass resources `scheduling.k8s.io/v1beta1` `scheduling.k8s.io/v1alpha1` requires at least kubernetes v1.14. `scheduling.k8s.io/v1` API requires kubernetes v1.17.

## Usage

Here is an example of how we instantiate this helm chart: 

```bash
helm upgrade --install --wait cluster-name silta-cluster \
             --repo "https://storage.googleapis.com/charts.wdr.io" \
             --values local-values.yaml            
```

## Components

#### SSH Jumphost

SSH Jumphost authentication is based on [sshd-gitAuth](https://github.com/wunderio/sshd-gitauth) project that will authorize users based on their SSH private key. The key whitelist is built by listing all users that belong to a certain github organisation.

You need to supply Github API Personal access token that will be used to get the list of organisation users. The access can be read only, following permissions are sufficient for the task: `public_repo, read:org, read:public_key, repo:status`.

#### Deployment remover

This is an exposed webhook that listens for branch delete events, logs in to cluster and removes named deployments using helm. Project code can be inspected at [silta-deployment-remover](https://github.com/wunderio/silta-deployment-remover).

#### Rclone storage

Provides persistent volume storageClass `silta-shared`, that allows mounting wide range of remote storage options to cluster pods.
